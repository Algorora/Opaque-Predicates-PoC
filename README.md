# Opaque-Predicates-PoC
This project is a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating the use of opaque predicates in Go. Opaque predicates are conditions that are constructed to always evaluate to true or false, but their true nature isn't immediately obvious. This technique is used to obfuscate code and make static and dynamic analysis more challenging.
